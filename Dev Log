Blacklist search to the database is now functional. Whitelist and individual weapon search will be easy to implement.

Next step though is to dress the page up better. I'd like to make the blacklist selections into something that looks like a
tabbed interface, where the whitelist and individual weapon search can be alternate tabs, so that the user can only
choose one of the database search options. Those tabs can just say "Coming soon!" until the whitelist and individual are
implemented.

I would also like to include a navigation bar at the top, where I can put an app title, my information (Github link,
Squidboards profile, personal website, Twitter???), and contact info (Github and maybe dev email).

Then I guess it can be taken online. Nevermind trying to literally set up a server in my basement, I'm also concerned
about database security. I'm not really in a place to set up cloud hosting, so I don't know where to start.
